The objective of the code is to simulate a crowdfunding market with consumers and 
producers, and see how diffrent advertising strategys affect it. 

To run the code you can either just open in IDE and press play or command line. 
There are parameters you can change to change the simulation, but it also has 
default values for each so they are not required,

The default values of the code are the values used for the first simulation shown in the table in the video
